# A QT Tomato Timer
I initially develop this timer for myself. Then, I realize this project is suitable for QT beginners. This project demonstrates:

1. How to use some basic widgets: button, spin box, label, LCD number
2. How to create a child window (a dialog), show and hide it
3. How to setup signals and slots
4. How to emit a signal carrying data from a child window to its parent window
5. How to use QTimer
6. How to use QMessageBox
7. How to use QDateTime
8. How to use QTextBrowser
9. How to use windows APIs in QT
10. How to save Chinese characters into QString

Since I'm a QT beginner, there're probably better ways to implement. If you find any issues, please let me know.
