# A QT Tomato Timer
I initially develop this timer for myself. Then, I realize this project is suitable for QT beginners. This project demonstrates:

1. How to use some basic widgets: button, spin box, label, LCD number
2. How to create a child window (a dialog), show and hide it
3. How to setup signals and slots
4. How to emit a signal carrying data from a child window to its parent window

Since I'm a QT beginner, there're probably better ways to implement. If you find any issues, please let me know.
